# Find a Sub-Word

"""
We define a word character to be any of the following:
• An English alphabetic letter (i.e., a-z and A-Z).
• A decimal digit (i.e., 0-9).
• An underscore (i.e., _, which corresponds to ASCII value 95).

We define a word to be a contiguous sequence of one or more word characters 
that is preceded and succeeded by one or more occurrences of non-word-characters 
or line terminators. For example, in the string I love-cheese_?, the words 
are I, love, and cheese_.

We define a sub-word as follows:
• A sequence of word characters (i.e., English alphabetic letters, digits, 
    and/or underscores) that occur in the same exact order 
    (i.e., as a contiguous sequence) inside another word.
• It is preceded and succeeded by word characters only.

Given n sentences consisting of one or more words separated by non-word 
characters, process q queries where each query consists of a single string, 
s. To process each query, count the number of occurrences of s as a sub-word 
in all n sentences, then print the number of occurrences on a new line.
input Format

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of sentences.

Each of the n subsequent lines contains a sentence consisting of words 
separated by non-word characters.

The next line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains a string, sᵢ, to check.

Constraints
• 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
• 1 ≤ q ≤ 10

Output Format
For each query string, sᵢ, print the total number of times it occurs as 
a sub-word within all words in all n sentences.

Sample input

1
existing pessimist optimist this is
1
is

Sample Output

3

Explanation

We must count the number of times s = is occurs as a sub-word in our n = 1 
input sentence(s):

• s occurs 1 time as a sub-word of existing.
• s occurs 1 time as a sub-word of pessimist.
• s occurs 1 time as a sub-word of optimist.
• While s is a substring of the word this, it's followed by a blank space; 
    because a blank space is non-alphabetic, non-numeric, and not an underscore, 
    we do not count it as a sub-word occurrence.
• While s is a substring of the word is in the sentence, we do not count it 
    as a match because it is preceded and succeeded by non-word characters 
    (i.e., blank spaces) in the sentence. This means it doesn't count as a 
    sub-word occurrence.

Next, we sum the occurrences of s as a sub-word of all our words as 
1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3. Thus, we print 3 on a new line.
